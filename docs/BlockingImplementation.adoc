= Blocking Support (Implementation Details)

As described in link:./BlockingSupport.adoc[BlockingSupport.adoc], ServiceTalk by default allows users to write blocking code when interacting with ServiceTalk.
This document describes the details of the implementation and is addressed to audiences who intend to know the internals of how this is achieved.
**It is not required to read this document if you just want to use ServiceTalk.**

== Asynchronous Sources

Everything inside ServiceTalk is somehow connected to one of the three asynchronous sources, viz., `Publisher`, `Single` and `Completable`.
Since these sources are the building block, supporting blocking code execution with these sources, makes it generic to be used anywhere and not just as a protection for netty `EventLoop`s.

== Threads and asynchronous sources

An asynchronous source has to decide at two points about which thread will be used:

1. Thread which is used to do the actual work related to a source. eg: for an HTTP client, the work is to send an HTTP request and read the HTTP response.
2. Thread which is used to interact with the `Subscriber` corresponding to its `Subscription`s.

Part 1. above is not governed by the ReactiveStreams specifications and hence sources are free to use any thread. ServiceTalk typically will use netty's `EventLoop` to do the actual work.
Part 2. defines all the interactions using the ReactiveStreams specifications, i.e. all methods in `Publisher`, `Subscriber` and `Subscription`.

ServiceTalk concurrency APIs defines which thread will be used by any asynchronous source for Part 2.

== Executor and asynchronous sources

ServiceTalk enforces that each asynchronous source **MUST** be associated with an `Executor` which is used to interact with its `Subscriber`.
Below diagram illustrates the interaction between an asynchronous source, its `Subscriber`, its operators, and the `Executor`.

The above interaction has a few important points:

- All operators inherit the `Executor` from the source, unless overridden explicitly by the user.
- An `Executor` thread is chosen when a `Subscriber` subscribes to a source decorated by zero or more operators.
- The chosen `Executor` thread is passed to all operators and then to the source, per `Subscriber`.

The above interaction provides all operators and the source an opportunity to piggy-back on the same thread for all interactions with the `Subscriber`.
Any operator in a chain has two options while accepting a `Subscriber`:

- Wrap the `Subscriber` such that all `Subscriber` and `Subscription` method calls are offloaded to the chosen `Executor` thread.
This mode is for operators that process signals from the original `Publisher` asynchronously.
- Do not wrap the `Subscriber` and forward all `Subscriber` and `Subscription` methods directly on the calling thread to avoid the overhead of wrapping each and every `Subscriber` and `Subscription` in a chain.
This mode is for operators that process signals from the original `Publisher` synchronously.

Taking the same example from link:./BlockingSupport.adoc[BlockingSupport.adoc]

[source, java]
----
 client.request() # <1>
       .map(resp -> {
            return resp.toString(); # <2>
       })
       .flatmap(stringResp -> { # <3>
            return client2.request(stringResp);
       })
       .filter(stringResp -> {
            stringResp.equals("Hello World");  # <4>
       });
----
<1> A hypothetical client which provides a `request()` method that returns a `Single<Response>`.
<2> Converting the response to a `String`.
<3> Call another `client2` that provides a new `Single` which is returned from `flatmap`.
<4> Only allow "Hello World" messages to be emitted.

In the above example the operators `map` and `filter` will not wrap `Subscriber` and `Subscription` since they do not do any asynchronous work.
However, `flatmap` will wrap `Subscriber` and `Subscription` to offload the calls to the chosen `Executor` thread.

== Why should we wrap `Subscriber` and `Subscription`?

There are two places we would wrap `Subscriber` and `Subscription`:

1. Original asynchronous sources.
2. Asynchronous operators. eg: `flatmap`

Since every asynchronous source is associated with an `Executor`, it is required to use the `Executor` for interacting with `Subscriber` and `Subscription`.

If we do not wrap for asynchronous operators then in the above example, operator `filter` (4) will be invoked in the `Executor` thread defined by `client2` inside the `flatmap`.
For a scenario, where `client2` uses an Executor; `executor1` that can not run blocking code and `client` that uses an `Executor`; `executor2` that can run blocking code,
not wrapping the `Subscriber` and `Subscription` inside `flatmap` maybe fatal as `filter` may run blocking code on `executor1`.
