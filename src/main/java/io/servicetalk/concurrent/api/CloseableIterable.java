/**
 * An {@link Iterable} which supports generation of {@link CloseableIterator}s.
 * <p>
 *     This interface is meant to be used in places where an {@link Iterator} returned by an {@link Iterable} contains
 *     state that is required to be cleared irrespective of whether data from the {@link Iterator} is completely
 *     consumed (i.e. {@link Iterator#hasNext()} is called till it returns {@code false}) or not.
 *     This interface provides a way for a user of such an {@link Iterable} to discard data, by calling
 *     {@link CloseableIterator#close()}.
 *     When using {@link CloseableIterator}, it is expected that the user will either consume all the data from the
 *     {@link Iterator} or explicitly call {@link AutoCloseable#close()} to dispose the remaining data.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of elements returned by the {@link CloseableIterator}.
